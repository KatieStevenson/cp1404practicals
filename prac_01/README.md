# Practical 01 contains the following:
- broken_score.py: Code was essentially 'broken'as scores greater than 100 could be entered AND print output would state "Invalid score", "Passable", "Excellent" and "Bad" regardless of the score provided. This has been fixed, see broken_score.py.
- temperatures.py: Added the ability to convert fahrenheit to celcius through an elif statement. See temperatures.py.
