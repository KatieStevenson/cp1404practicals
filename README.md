### CP1404 Directory README File

The CP1404 Directory contains practical work submitted for review by JCU Lecturers and Tutors.
The folder will contain (when finished) the entire 10 weeks worth of practical work.

## Formatting
Each folder will be presented as 'prac_xx' where 'xx' refers to number 1 to 10 (01, 02, 03...).
A README.md file will be present in each folder to explain the contents of the folder in more detail.
